AirWatch
========

The aim of the AirWatch project is to help deploy low cost networks of air-quality sensors that can deliver information on a street level. AirWatch hopes to enhance existing government monitoring technologies. Governments and citizens can use AirWatch data to improve their decisions and policies about air-pollution management.

AirWatch allows you to control your data (make fully private) but hope you will share your outdoor data to help grow the AirWatch network. 


Here you will find the details regarding the AirWatch sensors, so you can build your own and contribute to the AirWatch project. 

Version 1 of AirWatch supports 2 communication protocols. AirWatch WiFi uses your home WiFi network.

If you have access to the public TTN network [See here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/map) then AirWatch LoRa version is suitable.
