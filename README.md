AirWatch
========

The aim of the AirWatch project is to help deploy low cost networks of air-quality sensors that can deliver information on a street level. We hope to enhance existing government monitoring technologies. Governments and citizens can use this abundant data to inform their decisions about air-pollution management and improve their policies.


Here you will find the details regarding the AirWatch sensors, so you can build your own and contribute to the AirWatch project. 

Version 1 of AirWatch supports 2 communication protocols. AirWatch WiFi uses your home WiFi network.
If you have access to the public TTN network (see here) then AirWatch LoRa version is suitable.
